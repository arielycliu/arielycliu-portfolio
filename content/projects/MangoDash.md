Opening up the Facebook statistics

## 🥭Inspiration
We wanted to create a simple and intuitive way for social media influencers to track their analytics all in one place. MangoDash allows for the potential to perform cross platform comparisons, and to track growth over time.

## 🔍What it does
Users can signup or create a new account within our database, using their facebook or instagram API key. Then they are able to quickly view stats such as their friend count, total likes, average likes, max likes, total comments, average comments, max comments along with bar graphs of their likes and comments per post.

## 🔨How we built it

Entirely in Java Maven with JPanels
For the API we used Facebook and Instagram's Graph API
