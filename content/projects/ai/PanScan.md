## 🔍What it does
Our machine learning model takes in biomarker data for cancer antigens as inputs, and predicts your chances of having pancreatic cancer. This can be used to either validate a doctor's opinion quickly and easily.

## 🔨How I built it
We built our model in the Python language, with the Keras library with TensorFlow as a backend. This was done in Google Colab and Sublime Text for building and iteratively optimizing our model.
