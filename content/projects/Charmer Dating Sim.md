## How to Play
You are a succubi, and your goal is to find a date before the yearly New Year’s party. It’s a big deal for succubi, and you absolutely refuse to show up without a date for the third year in a row.

To help you out, Claire and you have organized a bit of a “dating party”. Claire has invited four unique potential dates for you to woo:  

#### Characters
1.  Chad: a pink haired lovely gentleman who loves to cook and play truth or dare.
2.  Ellie: a white haired reserved young lady who enjoys volunteering at the animal shelter.
3.  May: a short-haired girl who is passionate about games, coding, and swimming.
4.  Athena: we’re not sure why she’s here, but we know she’s sleepy.

#### The game progresses in two parts…

In the first half, you get to meet each of the characters and talk to them one at a time. If you don’t succeed in keeping them entertained or you manage to offend them, they will leave the party early. You start with 50 CHARM POINTS from Claire, and you can spend CHARM POINTS to potentially raise a date’s approval rating of you.

In the second half, out of the potential dates remaining you choose one you want to ask out to the New Year’s party. The rest of the dates become CHARM POINTS to help you woo your final date. You must choose the correct options to demonstrate an understanding of your partner’s character, and use your CHARM POINTS to successfully ask them out to the New Year’s party. Good luck!

#### Meet the team
Ariel - very sleep deprived as she is writing this rn. Knows Python, this is her first game.

Janice - life sci student who somehow got roped into this. Learnt how to code on the fly (very impressive but she’s kinda like Athena as in - we don’t know why she’s here)

Richard - comp sci student who showed up for the last day of the hackathon. Knows Java, also has not made a game before.

#### 📖TLDR
Charmer is a visual novel dating game made in RenPy. You play as a succubus who has charm powers and can use charm on certain lines of dialogue to woo your target.

## 🔨How we built it
I (Ariel) set up the game ui and mechanics in RenPy, coded in Python. Together with Janice we wrote lots and lots of dialogue. Richard helped us edit grammar and spelling mistakes.
