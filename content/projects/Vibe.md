## 🔍What it does
All users have the option to create and/or enroll in classes. There are no restrictions on the content of classes: Classes can educate on any topic under the sun. Classes are made of a number of lessons which can be added and edited individually and modularly. 

Once a teacher creates a class, they set a price to their class. Students can then purchase the class and leave ratings depending on their experience with the class. Each class comes with forum functionality and a chat room to encourage community-driven learning.

##### 📖TLDR
Vibe makes learning about learning by removing barriers to learning such as accessibility, affordability, and lack of engagement.

## 🔨How we built it
Vibe is a decentralized application that runs on the Ethereum ecosystem. The smart contracts are written in solidity, using the Truffle Framework, and deployed onto the Goerli Testnet. They are then integrated into the React frontend using the Web3 JS library. Vibe also makes use of the Interplanetary File System or IPFS to store lesson video content.
