> Makes 40.5 cookies (20.5 if halved - I've put the half amounts in brackets next to each ingredient)

If you've never had a Snickerdoodle it's kinda like the OG cookie to me - like a chocolate chip cookie with no chocolate chips in the best way. Perfectly slightly sweet due to the sugary coating it's rolled in, rounded out with the slightest hint of cinnamon.

It's my favorite cookie ever.

## üßàIngredients

#### Dough
- [ ] 225g butter at room temp (112g)
- [ ] 300g granulated sugar (130-150g)
- [ ] 1 large egg at room temp (1/2 an egg or ~23g)
- [ ] 1 tsp vanilla extract (1 tsp)
- [ ] 298g flour (150g)
- [ ] 1 tsp baking powder (1/2 tsp)

#### Topping Sugar
This is what you're rolling the cookie in
- [ ] 30g granulated sugar
- [ ] 1/4 tbsp ground cinnamon (I don't really like cinnamon, if you love it - go crazy)


## üç™Steps

1. Cream butter and sugar for 2-3 mins use the paddle (leaf-like) attachment
2. Add egg (gradually), add the vanilla (not gradually)
3. Sift in dry ingredients (gradually but nowadays I just dump it in all at once and rely on the stand mixer to do the hard work)
4. Stop the stand mixer when a nice dough forms with no pockets of flour remaining
5. Roll dough into balls, each ball around 20-21g (you can make then bigger or smaller but the 40 cookie estimate is based on 20g per cookie)
6. Roll balls in topping sugar (I usually like to use a deep bowl and roll the dough ball around in the topping)
7. Press down the dough until they are flat-ish disks around 1 cm thick. Cookies will expand on their own in the oven (unless you froze the dough)
8. Bake at 350F for 9-10 min (this really depends on the oven)
	1. Take out the cookies when they look slightly pale but mostly cooked
	2. The edges should be set and the center should look only slightly questionably gooey
	3. If you took it out too early and the cookie does not cool down to be a solid texture, just put them back in the oven
9. Enjoy! Hide them from your cat üêà

```
You can also freeze or refridgerate after partitioning out the dough into balls and adding the topping. You'll want to cover the balls in some airtight container to avoid them drying out.
You don't need to let them thaw before baking them but there are two side effects of being a bit impatient:
1) the cookies will not spread much if frozen
2) you'll need to bake the cookies longer (I think it's about 4 mins longer but depends on the oven, just eye it carefully)
